## Abstract

Cyber criminals use fake job postings to obtain personally identifiable information (PPI) from unknowing applicants. As students pursuing internships and employment in a job market undergoing circumstantial shifts, we are motivated to identify and avoid dangerous job postings that pose a threat to ourselves, our peers, and many others in their job search. Our core task is predicting the fraudulence of job postings using binary classification models based on job postingsâ€™ text features and meta-features extracted from contextual embedding models, and formulating actionable insights as to which description features are most indicative of fraud.
